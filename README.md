## ðŸ«€A Data-Driven Approach to Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
Goal. Build and compare classic ML models to predict heart disease using the Cleveland/UCI dataset.
Models. KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM (RBF), Decision Tree, Random Forest.
Highlights. 70/30 trainâ€“test split, z-score scaling, class rebalancing via oversampling, confusion-matrix based evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1).

**ðŸ“Š Summary of Model Performance**
	â€¢	Random Forest was the top performer (84% accuracy), excelling at detecting healthy individuals (Class 0 recall = 91%) while maintaining balanced metrics for diseased cases (Class 1 precision/recall = 75%).
	â€¢	Logistic Regression closely followed (83.5% accuracy), showing stable precision and recall above 85% overall, though it had a slight drop in recall for Class 1, leading to some missed disease cases.
	â€¢	K-Nearest Neighbors achieved 82.4% accuracy, with well-balanced metrics (precision: 80%/85%, recall: 87%/77%), confirming its reliability in binary classification.
	â€¢	Support Vector Machine (RBF) reached 80.2% accuracy, performing strongly on healthy cases (Class 0 recall = 85%) but lower on disease cases (Class 1 recall = 75%), suggesting bias toward the majority class.
	â€¢	Decision Tree had the lowest accuracy (78%), with decent recall for Class 1 (83%) but poor precision (68%), indicating higher false positives.

**ðŸ‘‰ Random Forest and Logistic Regression emerged as the most effective models, balancing interpretability, predictive strength, and recall.**
